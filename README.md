# ascii_art_service

Unfortunately I couldn't get this to work. It works perfectly fine if run just using `go run main.go` but the service panics on line 67 of asciiimageservice.go and I can't seem to figure out why.

This took me about 6 hours to write in total and I ended up forgoing writing tests because I had spent too much time just writing this and in the end counldn't get it to work.
